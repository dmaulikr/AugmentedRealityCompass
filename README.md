Augmented Reality Compass Initial Commit

####About
This app takes advantage of Augmented Reality and CoreLocation to deliver a realistic compass overlay to let the user know which direction he or she is facing. Whenever the device is rotated, the compass needle changes its direction to always point north.

####Usage
To use this app, simply press the "Show Augmented Reality Compass" Button and allow the app to access the camera. After that, the screen will display the compass over the camera view. Enjoy!
